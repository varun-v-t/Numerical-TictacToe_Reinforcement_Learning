# Numerical TictacToe Using Reinforcement Learning

## Objective
- an RL agent that learns to play Numerical Tic-Tac-Toe with odd numbers using Q-Learning.
- The environment is playing randomly with the agent, i.e. its strategy is to put an even number randomly in an empty cell. 
- If your agent wins the game, it gets 10 points, if the environment wins, the agent loses 10 points. And if the game ends in a draw, it gets 0. Also, you want the agent to win in as few moves as possible, so for each move, it gets a -1 point.
